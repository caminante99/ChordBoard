ChordBoard is an app that enables chord typing on a standard qwerty keyboard. The sofware is intended to be used on a touch screen keyboard allowing the users fingers to slide from chord to chord for super-fast typing. 
The algorithm takes scrambled words and attempts to decypher them using contextual as well as statistical methods. 

*This software was written to test the concept of chording on a qwerty keyboard. The algorithm was written in a few hours and is not optimized or intended to be used for anything other than a proof of concept.
